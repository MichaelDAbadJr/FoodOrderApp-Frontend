# FoodOrderApp - Frontend

## Overview

This is a React-based food ordering app where users can view available meals, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The app is built using a combination of React context for managing cart and user progress state, hooks for HTTP requests, and external APIs for fetching and posting order data. The frontend is designed to integrate seamlessly with a backend that processes orders and manages meals data.
